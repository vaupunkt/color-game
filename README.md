# 🎨🕹️ Color Guessing Game README 🕹️🎨

Welcome to the Color Guessing Game! This is a fun game where you can test your knowledge of colors and compete against yourself or your friends. This game has three different levels of difficulty, accessed through three buttons, each with its own unique challenge.

## 🔴🟢🔵 LEVELS 🔵🟢🔴

### 1️⃣ LEVEL 1:
In this level, you'll be given three different colors to choose from. Your task is to select the color that matches the color displayed on the screen. This level is a great way to get started and to warm up your color recognition skills.

### 2️⃣ LEVEL 2:
This level is a bit more challenging, as you will have to use a color picker to select the correct color. The color picker allows you to choose from a wide range of colors, and you'll have to use your intuition to select the right one. For this level, we use the deltaE algorithm from Lea Verou and Chris Lilley to calculate the score.

### 3️⃣ LEVEL 3:
This is the most difficult level, as you will have to enter the red, blue, and green values of the color by yourself. This level requires a strong understanding of color theory, and it's a great way to challenge yourself and improve your skills. As with Level 2, I use the deltaE algorithm to calculate the score.

## 💯 SCORING SYSTEM 💯

For Levels 2 and 3, I use the deltaE algorithm to calculate the score. The deltaE algorithm is a color difference formula that takes into account the way the human eye perceives color. This algorithm was developed by Lea Verou and Chris Lilley, who are both experts in color theory and editors of the CSS Color specifications. You can learn more about the deltaE algorithm and how it works by visiting the link: https://colorjs.io/docs/color-difference.html.
